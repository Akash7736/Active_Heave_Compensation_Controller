# Active_Heave_Compensation_Controller
This repository is created for Controller codes for Active Heave Compensation in maritime sector.
AHC DEMO MODEL
To demonstrate the active heave compensation (AHC) technology, we can create a 
simple model using a spring isolator to simulate the heave motion of a ship and a 
stepper motor to act as a winch. The purpose of this demo is to illustrate how an 
AHC system can counteract the heave motion and maintain a stable position.
To begin, we can use a sturdy base, such as a wooden board, to hold the components 
of the demo model. Next, we can attach a spring isolator to the base using screws. 
The spring isolator can be a simple metal spring with one end attached to the base 
and the other end attached to a hook.

We can then mount a stepper motor on the base using screws. The motor will act as 
the winch in this model. We can connect the winch to a rope or cable that is attached 
to a load, which can be represented by a small weight or object. The load should be 
suspended above the spring isolator, which will simulate the heave motion.
To activate the AHC system, we can use a microcontroller or a simple electronic 
circuit. The microcontroller can be programmed to detect the motion of the load
using a sensor, such as an accelerometer or a gyroscope. When the load moves up or 
down due to the heave motion, the microcontroller can signal the stepper motor to 
move in the opposite direction, counteracting the heave motion and maintaining the 
load in a stable position.
We can demonstrate the AHC system by manually moving the spring isolator up and 
down, simulating the heave motion of a ship. As the spring moves, the load will also 
move up and down. However, the AHC system will detect the motion and signal the 
stepper motor to move in the opposite direction, keeping the load in a stable position.
In conclusion, this simple demo model using a spring isolator and a stepper motor 
provides a basic illustration of how an AHC system can counteract heave motion 
and maintain a stable position. This technology has various applications in the 
marine and offshore industries, where it can improve safety, efficiency, and accuracy 
of operations
